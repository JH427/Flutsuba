# flutsuba

An imageboard BBS in Flutter, inspired by Yotsuba.

## A lot to do...

Login, Register, and Verify Emai views need UI improvements

Create Boards

## features I would like

Unlike normal imageboards users must create accounts
- creates a basic sense of accountability
- better user behavior(?)
- better user features, monitor your posts more easily
- persistent settings

However, when posting users should have levels of anonymity
- post anonymously. the post is anonymous to other users but not to us
- post with an anonymous identity (tripcodes)
- post publicly, identity is shared with other users

The number of max threads should start small and scale, same with replies
- max threads/replies per user (unless VIP) ?
